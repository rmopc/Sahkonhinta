# SähköSpot Android app 

As part of my education I developed a mobile app for Andrdoid with the purpose of following the hourly spot-price of electricity. The app is and has been in continuous development after my graduation.

The app features the current hourly price, daily high/low and daily average prices as well as hourly prices as a list for the current day. The user may select the VAT-percentage to be displayed. The app responds to dark-mode aswell as light-mode.

Planned features: <br /> 
-Spot-provision as a separate field, said provision to be optionaly added to the hourly prices  <br /> 
-Datepicker for selecting prices for any day in the past  <br /> 
-Widget and/or alarm-notification  <br />
